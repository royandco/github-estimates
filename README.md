# Roy & Co GitHub Estimates

## Chrome Extension for GitHub
This extension provides the ability to set estimates for issues on GitHub by implementing a new menu in the sidebar.

## Known Bugs
- Any comment with the estimate data is read regardless of if the estimate data is the only thing in the comment
- Estimates sometimes break when creating (still shows properly on refresh, etc.)
